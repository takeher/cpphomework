## eigenfaces ##

Eigenfaces implementation using the OpenCV2 C++ API. There's a very basic function for loading the dataset, you probably want to make this a bit more sophisticated. The dataset is available at [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html).

## lbp ##

Implements various Local Binary Patterns with the OpenCV2 C++ API:
  
* Original LBP
* Circular LBP (also known as Extended LBP)
* Variance-based LBP

Basic code for spatial histograms and histogram matching with a chi-square distance is included, but it's not finished right now. There's a tiny demo application you can experiment with.
